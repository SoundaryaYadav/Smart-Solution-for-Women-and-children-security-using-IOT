# Smart-Solution-for-Women-and-children-security-using-IOT
This project aims at providing security to women and children from violence or physical threats.
But how?
Mainly this concept is implemented in wearable devices such as pendant and watch.
So as soon as attacker tries to attack the woman the GSM module inside the pendant /watch gives notifications to women's close contacts by sending women's current location with a emergency message and also
the buzzer inside the pendant/watch creates a alarming sound inorder to avoid the attacks in mere future.

Tools used: GSM MODULE , NODE MCU , UDM SENSOR , ESP 8266 , MAX 232 , PANIC SWITCH ,LED ,BUZZER.
Use the block diagram shown as in demonstration to connect the devices.
Use arduino ide to run the code.
Use the Blynk app to send notifications to women's close contacts.
